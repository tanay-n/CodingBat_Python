#Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. 
#However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- 
#then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. 
#Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value 
#and returns that value fixed for the teen rule. 
#In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). 
#Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().
